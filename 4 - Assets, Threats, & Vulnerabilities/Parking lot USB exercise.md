## **Parking lot USB exercise**

| Contents | *The USB drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files, including family and pet photos, new hire letters, and employee shift schedules. These files can contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, addresses, and other personal details of employees and their families. Storing personal files alongside sensitive work files is not safe, as it increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information, especially if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised by malware* |

| **Attacker mindset** | *An attacker could exploit the personal and work-related files on the USB drive to gain unauthorized access to Rhetorical Hospital's systems. By loading the drive with malware, such as keystroke injection or firmware reprogramming, the attacker could establish a backdoor, steal sensitive information, or execute malicious commands once the device is plugged into a workstation. This could compromise employee data, patient records, and other confidential hospital information, potentially leading to significant data breaches and system disruptions* |
| **Risk analysis** | *To mitigate USB-based attacks, several technical, operational, and managerial controls can be implemented. Technically, disabling the Autorun feature and using antivirus software to scan USB drives for malware before accessing their contents are crucial. Operationally, enforcing strict device control policies, such as allowing only authorized USB devices and implementing content inspection to detect or block the transfer of sensitive information, can prevent data exfiltration and malware introduction. This includes using hardware-encrypted USB drives with password protection and remote management capabilities to ensure data security. Managerially, educating employees about the risks associated with USB drives, such as USB baiting attacks and Bad USB vulnerabilities, and establishing clear policies on the use of personal and business USB drives can significantly reduce the threat. Separating personal and business USB drives and maintaining regular software updates and security patches are also essential managerial controls* |
