## Intro

I am Andrzej Raczkowski. I am an independent software developer. 

With over 21 years of experience in Oracle technologies, including Oracle Database & PL/SQL, Oracle APEX, and Oracle BI Publisher, I have honed my development skills across various platforms. My expertise extends to full-stack JavaScript, Python, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), allowing me to create robust, scalable systems and applications.

In addition to my deep technical knowledge, I am leveraging these development skills to build a strong Cybersecurity portfolio. I apply my programming and system architecture expertise to secure software development, vulnerability analysis, and implementing security controls, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. By combining my strengths in development with a focus on security, I aim to enhance both the functionality and protection of business-critical systems.

Recently, I completed the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity.  This topic suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats.

## Portfolio

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my journey to earn the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This program has provided insights into:

* Programming for cybersecurity tasks
* Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
