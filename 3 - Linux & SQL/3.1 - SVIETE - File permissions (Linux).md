# File permissions in Linux

## Project description

In this scenario, the research team tasked me to modify the permissions for files and directories within the project directory. The operating system is Linux, indicating that the tasks require a command-line interface (Linux Bash shell) approach via Linux Terminal.

## Check file and directory details

To begin with, I wrote the command ls to display what directories are available. As the result goes, the `project` is the only directory listed. Then, the command ls with the `-la` displays file contents as well as the hidden files within the directory of the `project`. The result shows
file contents as well as the hidden files within the directory of the project. The result shows there is one hidden file within the project directory. The hidden file naming conventions start with a period (.), followed by its name. In this case, ”.project_x.txt” is the hidden
file. Other findings include four project files (ends with .txt) and one drafts directory.

## Describe the permissions string

The 10-character string determines the authorization of accessing the file and their specific permissions. The characters and what they represent are as follows - we’ll take the first row from the picture above:

* `1st character`: This character is either a `d` or hyphen `-` and indicates the file type. Character `d` shows that it is a directory and drafts is the example. A hyphen `-` showsthat it is a regular file.
* `2nd-4th characters`: These characters indicate the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the user. When one of these characters is a hyphen (-) instead, it indicates that this permission is not granted to the user.
* `5th-7th characters`: These characters indicate the read (r), write (w), and execute (x)permissions for the group. When one of these characters is a hyphen (-) instead, it indicates that this permission is not granted for the group.
● `8th-10th` characters: These characters indicate the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for others. It includes all other users on the system that are not users and the group. When one of these characters is a hyphen (-) instead, that indicates that this permission is not granted for others.

## Change file permissions

The command `chmod` allows us to change the file permissions. To do this, there are some important notes:

1. The command `chmod u+(r/w/x) project file name` allows us to add the file
permissions for the users.
2. The command `chmod u-(r/w/x) project file name` allows us to remove the
file permissions for the users.
3. The command `chmod g+(r/w/x) project file name` allows us to add the file
permissions for the groups.
4. The command `chmod g-(r/w/x) project file name` allows us to remove the
file permissions for the group.
5. The command `chmod o+(r/w/x) project file name` allows us to add the file
permissions for others.
6. The command `chmod o-(r/w/x) project file name` allows us to remove the
file permissions for others.

### Changes that I made:

1. I wrote the command `chmod o-w project_k.txt` to remove write permissions
from the file.
2. I wrote the command `chmod g-r project_m.txt` to remove read permissions from the file.

## Change file permissions on a hidden file

The command chmod also allows us to change the file permissions for the hidden files. As for “.project_x.txt”, I would like to remove the write permissions for the users and the group while maintaining read permissions for the group. The following code is able to make it happen
in a single line of code:
`chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt`

## Change directory permissions

The command `chmod g-x drafts` will authorize only `researcher2` to gain access to drafts directory.

## Summary

This scenario demonstrates my capability to match the level of authorization my organization set for files and directories in the project directory. The command `ls -la` displays all the files in the directory while `chmod` allows you to change permissions and directories.
